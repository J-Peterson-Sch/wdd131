          <h2>Fundamentals of Building a Pizza</h2>
          <p>Below I outline the steps and some of the techniques I’ve learned about pizza making. While none of them 
            are particularly difficult it will take patience and practice to master them. Fortunately it’s pretty hard 
            to get sick of pizza, and practicing is a lot of fun. Just take your time and be deliberate the first 
            couple of times and everything will go smoothly.</p>

              <h2>Shaping the Dough</h2>
              <ol>
                <li>Portion out the dough by weight.
                  <ul>
                    <li>10" crust = 175g</li>
                    <li>12" crust = 250g</li>
                    <li>14" crust = 350g</li>
                    <li>16" crust = 450g</li>
                    <li>18" crust = 580g</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Form the dough into balls. I do this by stretching one of the sides and tucking them at the bottom. 
                  Then I rotate the ball and do it again. Over doing this shaping step can result in the top forming 
                  tears in the surface.</li>
                <li>Place the dough balls in a flour dusted proofing basket and allow to proof for two to three 
                  hours. You will know they are done when, if given a gentle poke, it leaves a slight indentation in 
                  the dough.</li>
                <li>When the dough is finished proofing lightly dust a work surface with flour. Remove a dough ball, 
                  being careful to not stretch it out of shape. Place it on your work surface. If the dough is 
                  sticky very lightly dust it with flour.</li>
                <li>Define where the crust of the pizza will be by using your finger tips to press around the edge 
                  of the crust. When you’re done you will have pressed a circle into the dough, leaving a dome in 
                  the middle.</li>
                <li>Now using your finger tips press down on the dome in the middle. The goal is to press out all 
                  of the air trapped in what will be the crust under the toppings, while leaving the air in what 
                  will be the crust on the edges. When this is done it you should have a nice smooth ring of 
                  dough on the outer edge, and a flatted inner circle covered in your finger marks.</li>
                <li>Now you need to gently stretch out the dough to the size of crust you are making. I do this by 
                  picking up the dough and placing the fingers of my right hand under the dough on the edge of 
                  where the crust part meets the flattened part. Then I let the rest of the dough hang down, using 
                  my left hand to help guide it. Gravity will start to stretch the dough. Keep rotating the dough. 
                  As it gets bigger you can start to help stretch it with your left hand, or start to toss it the 
                  air with a spinning motion. Be careful to try and not stretch the outer crust more than you need 
                  to, and to keep the thickness of the inner crust even.</li>
                <li>Place your finished crust on a floured pizza peel.</li>
              </ol>

              <h2>Top the Pizza</h2>
                <ol>
                  <li>Spread the sauce on the crust. Apply it evenly right up to the crust line.</li>
                  <li>Layering Considerations
                    <ul>
                      <li>Generally speaking, all of your topping go under the cheese, with the exception of a 
                        pepperoni pizza. This is just a general rule, and you can play with having other things 
                        on top.</li>
                      <li>Try not to add too much to your pizza. If you have too many toppings and cheese you 
                        might have a hard time getting everything in the middle to cook without the crust burning.</li>
                      <li>With the high temperatures of a gas or wood fire pizza oven you need to remember that 
                        anything on top of the cheese will be exposed to high heat. I’ve found that thin sliced 
                        pepperoni or other toppings will burn quickly.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Make sure that when you are putting the cheese on the pizza that it makes it all the way 
                    to the edge of the crust. When the cheese melts in the oven it’s important that it fuses to 
                    the crust, or when you take the first bite all of the cheese and toppings will want to pull 
                    off.</li>
                  <li>Make sure to periodically shake the pizza peel back and forth to confirm the the dough 
                    isn’t sticking.</li>
                </ol>

              <h2>Baking the Pizza</h2>
                <ol>
                  <li>Start heating your oven 30 - 45 minutes before you think you’ll be done topping the first pizza.</li>
                  <li>I’ve found that you want the oven temp between 750 and 800 degrees F. Use a thermal temperature 
                    probe to verify that the stone has gotten up to temperature. It’s okay if it’s a bit cooler than 
                    the rest of the oven.</li>
                  <li>Give the pizza peel with your uncooked pizza on it a good shake back and forth to make sure it’s 
                    loose before you go to put it in the oven.</li>
                  <li>Slide the pizza into the oven and close the door.</li>
                  <li>Wait 30 - 45 seconds for the bottom of the crust to set.</li>
                  <li>Using a turning peel, rotate the pizza 30 degrees. Wait five to fifteen seconds, then rotate again. 
                    Repeat until you have rotated the pizza all the way around.</li>
                  <li>Lift the pizza up a bit and check how cooked the bottom is. If it’s looking done try to keep the 
                    peel under it as much as possible to prevent it from burning.</li>
                  <li>When the crust is browned to your preference, and the cheese is starting to get little toasty brown 
                    bits on it, pull the pizza out.</li>
                  <li>I prefer to place it on a wire rack initially to help moisture from the crust escape. This helps 
                    prevent a soggy bottom.</li>
                  <li>After the pizza has cooled for a couple of minutes, transfer it to a cutting board and cut into 
                    slices and serve.</li>
                </ol>
